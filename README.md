Car Crashes - Survival Prediction
Course: Machine Learning - 1
This project analyzes car crash data to develop predictive models for survival outcomes. By identifying key factors influencing survival, we aim to assist the Department of Road Transport formulate effective safety regulations. The model will provide valuable insights into the impact of various factors on crash severity, enabling targeted interventions to reduce fatalities and injuries on the road.

Skills & Tools Covered:

Naive Bayes
Decision tree
Pruning
Classification metrics
My Learnings:
üìä 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed crash-related variables such as vehicle type, speed, safety equipment used, driver demographics, etc. Detected patterns and trends in survival outcomes based on crash characteristics. Identified and addressed missing values, outliers, and feature distributions to prepare clean data for modeling. ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Data Preprocessing: Performed feature encoding, normalization, and class balancing to make the data suitable for classification algorithms. üß† 3. Supervised Classification Models: Built and compared multiple classification algorithms to predict survival outcomes: Logistic Regression for baseline binary classification and interpretability K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify based on similarity with past cases Naive Bayes for fast, probabilistic predictions Decision Tree for rule-based modeling with intuitive logic Applied tree pruning techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. üìà 4. Model Evaluation: Used key classification metrics to evaluate model performance: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score Confusion Matrix to analyze true vs. false predictions Learned to assess model trade-offs between false positives and false negatives‚Äîcritical in survival prediction. üß† 5. Insights for Road Safety Strategy: Identified key factors impacting survival, such as: Seatbelt use Type of collision Time of day and road type Delivered data-driven recommendations for improving safety standards, vehicle design, and driver awareness programs. üí° Overall Takeaway: Learned to apply core machine learning classification models to predict life-critical outcomes and support public safety policy. This project developed my skills in EDA, model building, evaluation, and interpretation, especially in a high-impact, real-world context.
